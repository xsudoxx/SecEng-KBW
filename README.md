## Welcome

Welcome to the Security Engineering (Key Board Warrior) Repo. This repository is dedicated to providing structured and comprehensive coding lessons for aspiring security engineers. Our goal is to orient scripting and programming languages with a Cyber Security focus, enabling anyone starting their career or wanting to switch into security to do so effectively.

## Overview

This repository is organized into a series of lessons and projects that build upon each other. Each lesson introduces key concepts in both programming and security, gradually increasing in complexity to help you develop strong, practical skills.

## Getting Started
